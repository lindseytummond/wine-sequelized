## Future Enhancements:
Future developments would include creating additional features to include wine tasting notes, scoring, and an API to Global Wine Score to search for wine.

## Learning Points:
- File management for different sections of a project for clear organization for fellow developers future use.
- Creating an `orm.js` file within the config directory to setup the code to connect Node to MySQL.
- Defining methods `all`, `create`, and `update` to execute necessary MySQL commands in the controllers in order to retrieve and store data in the database.
- Utilizing Handlebars templates to generate client-side HTML.
